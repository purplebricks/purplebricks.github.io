# Kasper, this is markdown

Markdown is a really simple way of spitting our html. It's supports inline code `this.ShowCode()` which is nice.

    var ShowCode = function() {
      console.log('ooh, some more code');
    }

## H2 is also supported
### So is H3

Which is nice.

You can do lists:
  1. Which is nice
  2. Which is reasonable

You can:
  - Also show bullet points
  - which I kinda like

Markdown is great, go Google it.

Images are always a nice edition ![](/assets/blog/2014-11-28-kacpers-1st-blog/mind_blown.gif)
